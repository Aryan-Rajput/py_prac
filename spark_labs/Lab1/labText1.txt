Lab 1 — RDD basics: transformations vs actions
Goal: Understand laziness + lineage.\Interview test: “When does Spark actually compute?”


Transformations build a DAG; actions trigger execution.
Lineage lets Spark recompute partitions (fault tolerance).
GS loves when you can say: “Spark is lazy; action triggers job; shuffle creates stage boundaries.”
